You are using asset FreeFlyCamera (Version 1.1)

It emulates control of the Scene editor camera in Play mode (in-game screen).

It is very convenient for quick scene adding and to use it for transition in it while staying in play mode. Load the asset and just drag the script to the main camera “FreeFlyCamera.cs” – ready to use.

You can change parameters of rotation rate, movement, increase of transition speed, acceleration. You can activate/deactivate the rotation, transition, acceleration of movement speed.
